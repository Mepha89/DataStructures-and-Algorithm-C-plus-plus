# DataStructures-and-Algorithm-C-plus-plus
This is a repository for my solutions to the Assignments for the course Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) - 4400 for Data Strcutures and Algorithms in C++ , at Memorial University of Newfoundland and Labrador.
Course work that examines fundamental data structures; recursive structures and generic programming techniques; modularity and reusability; time complexity and efficient data structures; procedural abstraction; data abstraction and precise documentation of data structures.
